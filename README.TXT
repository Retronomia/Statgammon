========================
      HOW TO PLAY
========================
Goal: get both pieces to the other side of the board
-The first piece is "1"
-The second piece is "2"
-When pieces are at the same position, the value is shown as "3"
-Empty spaces are "0"
-To get the piece to the end, the number on the die must be the exact value needed
-Numerical responses are typed in as input when prompted
========================
   RUNNING THE FILE
========================
To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder and
type the following:

java -jar "Statgammon.jar" 

Example: java -jar C:\Users\NAME\Desktop\Statgammon\Statgammon.jar

I recommend opening a window and pasting the entire command with the file path into it to make
everything easier.
